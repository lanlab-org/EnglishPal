(Photo: EPA-EFE)\n\nLONDON – British Prime Minister Boris Johnson said Thursday he will likely ask Parliament to approve an election as part of an effort to break a Brexit deadlock.\n\nIt is not clear if the vote, which Johnson wants to hold on Dec. 12, will take place as opposition lawmakers must also back the move.\n\nThey are expected to vote on the measure on Monday. \n\nJohnson''s announcement comes ahead of an expected decision Friday from the European Union over whether to delay Britain''s exit from the bloc for three months. \n\nBritain''s leader has been steadfastly opposed to any extension to the nation''s scheduled Oct. 31 departure date from the EU, although in a letter to the leader of the opposition Labour Party this week he said he would accept a short technical postponement, "say to 15 or 30 November," to allow lawmakers to implement an EU withdrawal bill. \n\nJohnson''s decision to offer to call an election follows lawmakers'' rejection of his plan to rush through an EU exit bill that runs to hundreds of pages in just three days. They want more time to scrutinize the legislation and to make sure it does not leave the door open to a possible "no-deal" Brexit during future exit negotiations with the EU that will run through next year. A "no-deal" Brexit could dramatically harm Britain''s economy. \n\nThe prime minister was forced to ask for an extension to Britain''s EU departure date after Britain''s Parliament passed a law to ward off the threat of a "no-deal" Brexit.\n\nJohnson has repeatedly pledged to finalize the first stage, a transition deal, of Britain''s EU divorce battle by Oct. 31. A second stage will involve negotiating its future relationship with the EU on trade, security and other salient issues.\n','\n',char(10)),'https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2019/10/24/brexit-boris-johnson-eu-extension-withdrawal-deal/4084970002/','24 Oct 2019','4',replace('QUESTION\n\n1.

The process cleared reviews by\nthe GAO and Court of Federal Claims," the Pentagon said in a\nstatement Friday night announcing the award. "All offerors were\ntreated fairly and evaluated consistently with the solicitation''s\nstated evaluation criteria. Prior to the award, the department\nconferred with the DOD Inspector General, which informed the\ndecision to proceed."\n\nAmazon said it was "surprised" by the decision, but declined to\nsay if it would be filing a protest.\n\n"[Amazon Web Services] is the clear leader in cloud computing,\nand a detailed assessment purely on the comparative offerings\nclearly lead to a different conclusion," a spokesperson for the\ncompany said in a statement. "We remain deeply committed to\ncontinuing to innovate for the new digital battlefield where\nsecurity, efficiency, resiliency, and scalability of resources\ncan be the difference between success and failure.”\n\nMicrosoft did not immediately have a statement to provide.\n\nIt''s unclear what impact President Donald Trump''s criticism of\nAmazon and its founder Jeff Bezos had on the final contract\ndecision. Trump allegedly told former Defense Secretary Jim\nMattis that he wanted to "screw" Amazon by denying them the\ncontract, according to a book by former Mattis aide Guy Snodgrass\nthat is set to be released next week.\n\nWhether Amazon protests will depend on what the company hears\nwhen it receives a briefing from the Pentagon on the agency''s\ndecision making on why it selected Microsoft, according to Andrew\nHunter, a former Defense Department acquisition aide and current\nsenior fellow at the Center for Strategic and International\nStudies.\n\n"If it wasn’t close, then Amazon may not protest. If it was\nclose, I think they are pretty likely to protest given all the\nunusual activity on this procurement," Hunter told POLITICO. "My\nguess is that this competition came down to price."\n\nThe winner-take-all project is intended to establish a common\ncomputing and data storage system that will allow the military to\nachieve some of its most advanced technology objectives,\nincluding integrating onto the battlefield more artificial\nintelligence capabilities, which require massive amounts of\nprocessing power and storage that are provided by a sophisticated\ncloud. The program will also allow for secure information sharing\nacross the Defense Department, so warfighting intelligence can be\nseamless shared among different platforms like drones, aircraft\nor ships.\n\nThe Joint Enterprise Defense Infrastructure program, better known\nas JEDI, could be extended for 10 years and be worth up to $10\nbillion if all contract options are exercised.\n\nBut it is almost certain that Microsoft''s selection will not be\nthe final word for a program that has been politically fraught\nand the target of a series of court challenges and other formal\nprotests.\n\n“There is really no downside to protesting, except perhaps the\nill will it might generate by causing additional delay,” said Tom\nSpoehr, the director of the Heritage Foundation’s Center for\nNational Defense. “Given all the effort that the companies have\nput into their bids, a protest would not be surprising.”\n\nThe competition went through several phases before Amazon and\nMicrosoft emerged as finalists over Oracle and IBM Corp., which\nwere among the initial bidders.\n\nOracle took the Pentagon to court in December after it was cut\nfrom the competition, alleging that the Defense Department\nunfairly limited competition by tailoring the JEDI requirements\nto Amazon''s proposed solution.\n\nOracle also claimed in its lawsuit that Deap Ubhi, a former\nPentagon employee who worked for Amazon, unfairly influenced the\ncompetition. In July, however, a federal judge ruled in favor of\nthe Pentagon and also concluded that Oracle''s initial proposal\ndid not meet the contract requirements. Oracle announced in\nAugust that it would appeal that ruling to the U.S. Court of\nAppeals for the Federal Circuit, but has not yet formally filed\nthe appeal.\n\nOracle separately filed a protest in August 2018 with the\nGovernment Accountability Office, which also concluded that the\nPentagon’s procurement process was fair.\n\nWhile Oracle has been the most vocal critic of the program, IBM\nCorp. also filed a protest with the Government Accountability\nOffice in October 2018 arguing that the Pentagon should select\nmultiple winners instead of structuring the competition as\nwinner-takes-all.\n\n"IBM has long raised serious concerns about the structure of the\nJEDI procurement," IBM spokesperson Adam Pratt said in July. "We\ncontinue to believe that the Department of Defense and our men\nand women in uniform would be best served by a multicloud\nstrategy."\n\nPresident Trump, who has been engaged in a public spat with\nAmazon founder Jeff Bezos, accusing the billionaire of using his\nownership of The Washington Post to attack him, took a personal\ninterest in the JEDI competition ahead of the contract being\nawarded.\n\nIn July he asked officials to review the contracting process\nafter both members of Congress and companies themselves\ncomplained to the president that the bidding process was not open\nand competitive.\n\n“I’m getting tremendous complaints about the contract with the\nPentagon and with Amazon,” Trump said on July 18. “Some of the\ngreatest companies in the world are complaining about it, having\nto do with Amazon and the Department of Defense, and I will be\nasking them to look at it very closely to see what’s going on.”\n\n\nThe public spat between Trump and Bezos extends beyond this\ndefense procurement. Trump has attacked the billionaire on\nTwitter for paying too little in taxes and ripping off the\nU.S. Postal Service.\n\nLawmakers on both sides of the aisle also urged the president to\nget involved to ensure the competition was fair and the Pentagon\nwould be getting the best deal possible. For example, about a\ndozen members of the House GOP caucus, who are not members of the\nHouse Armed Services Committee, sent a letter in July asking the\npresident to delay the program until the Pentagon had finished\ninvestigating the fairness of the competition.\n\nThose who serve on the committees that oversee the military,\nhowever, tend to disagree. Two Democrats — Sen. Mark\nWarner (D-Va.) and Senate Armed Services Committee ranking member\nSen. Jack Reed (D-R.I.) — wrote a similar letter to the Pentagon\nin August asking Defense Secretary Mark Esper to protect the\nprogram from political pressure and keep it moving forward. Four\nRepublican members of the House Armed Services Committee,\nincluding ranking member Mac Thornberry, also sent a letter to\nTrump in July asking the president to allow the program to\ncontinue without interference.\n\n“While it is understandable that some of the companies competing\nfor the contract are disappointed at not being selected as one of\nthe finalists, further unnecessary delays will only damage our\nsecurity and increase the cost of the contract,” the GOP\nlawmakers wrote in the letter.\n\nIn response, Defense Secretary Mark Esper announced shortly after\ntaking over the Pentagon’s top job that he was personally\nreviewing the program, saying that he wanted to get up to speed\non the major procurement through a series of learning sessions\nwith Defense officials. During a series of listening sessions,\nEsper realized how contentious the program truly was and removed\nhimself from the decision-making process because his son worked\nfor IBM. Instead, he delegated the authority to Deputy Defense\nSecretary David Norquist.\n\nFor good measure, the Pentagon''s inspector general also conducted\nits own review, which began in August. The Pentagon said it had\nconsulted with the inspector general before issuing the award and\nwas told it could move forward.\n','\n',char(10)),'https://www.politico.com/news/2019/10/25/pentagon-microsoft-cloud-trump-058083','27 Oct 2019','4',replace('QUESTION\n\nANSWER\n','\n',char(10)));

The team of astrophysicists and geochemists presents new evidence that the Earth is not unique.\n\n\nEarth-like planets may be common in the universe, a new UCLA study implies. The team of astrophysicists and geochemists presents new evidence that the Earth is not unique. The study was published in the journal Science on Oct. 18.\n\n"We have just raised the probability that many rocky planets are like the Earth, and there''s a very large number of rocky planets in the universe," said co-author Edward Young, UCLA professor of geochemistry and cosmochemistry.\n\nThe scientists, led by Alexandra Doyle, a UCLA graduate student of geochemistry and astrochemistry, developed a new method to analyze in detail the geochemistry of planets outside of our solar system. Doyle did so by analyzing the elements in rocks from asteroids or rocky planet fragments that orbited six white dwarf stars.\n\n"We''re studying geochemistry in rocks from other stars, which is almost unheard of," Young said.\n\n"Learning the composition of planets outside our solar system is very difficult," said co-author Hilke Schlichting, UCLA associate professor of astrophysics and planetary science. "We used the only method possible -- a method we pioneered -- to determine the geochemistry of rocks outside of the solar system."\n\nWhite dwarf stars are dense, burned-out remnants of normal stars. Their strong gravitational pull causes heavy elements like carbon, oxygen and nitrogen to sink rapidly into their interiors, where the heavy elements cannot be detected by telescopes. The closest white dwarf star Doyle studied is about 200 light-years from Earth and the farthest is 665 light-years away.\n\n"By observing these white dwarfs and the elements present in their atmosphere, we are observing the elements that are in the body that orbited the white dwarf," Doyle said. The white dwarf''s large gravitational pull shreds the asteroid or planet fragment that is orbiting it, and the material falls onto the white dwarf, she said. "Observing a white dwarf is like doing an autopsy on the contents of what it has gobbled in its solar system."\n\nThe data Doyle analyzed were collected by telescopes, mostly from the W.M. Keck Observatory in Hawaii, that space scientists had previously collected for other scientific purposes.\n\n"If I were to just look at a white dwarf star, I would expect to see hydrogen and helium," Doyle said. "But in these data, I also see other materials, such as silicon, magnesium, carbon and oxygen -- material that accreted onto the white dwarfs from bodies that were orbiting them."\n\nWhen iron is oxidized, it shares its electrons with oxygen, forming a chemical bond between them, Young said. "This is called oxidation, and you can see it when metal turns into rust," he said. "Oxygen steals electrons from iron, producing iron oxide rather than iron metal. We measured the amount of iron that got oxidized in these rocks that hit the white dwarf. We studied how much the metal rusts."\n\nRocks from the Earth, Mars and elsewhere in our solar system are similar in their chemical composition and contain a surprisingly high level of oxidized iron, Young said. "We measured the amount of iron that got oxidized in these rocks that hit the white dwarf," he said.\n\nThe sun is made mostly of hydrogen, which does the opposite of oxidizing -- hydrogen adds electrons.\n\nThe researchers said the oxidation of a rocky planet has a significant effect on its atmosphere, its core and the kind of rocks it makes on its surface. "All the chemistry that happens on the surface of the Earth can ultimately be traced back to the oxidation state of the planet," Young said. "The fact that we have oceans and all the ingredients necessary for life can be traced back to the planet being oxidized as it is. The rocks control the chemistry."\n\nUntil now, scientists have not known in any detail whether the chemistry of rocky exoplanets is similar to or very different from that of the Earth.\n\nHow similar are the rocks the UCLA team analyzed to rocks from the Earth and Mars?\n\n"Very similar," Doyle said. "They are Earth-like and Mars-like in terms of their oxidized iron. We''re finding that rocks are rocks everywhere, with very similar geophysics and geochemistry."\n\n"It''s always been a mystery why the rocks in our solar system are so oxidized," Young said. "It''s not what you expect. A question was whether this would also be true around other stars. Our study says yes. That bodes really well for looking for Earth-like planets in the universe."\n\nWhite dwarf stars are a rare environment for scientists to analyze.\n\nThe researchers studied the six most common elements in rock: iron, oxygen, silicon, magnesium, calcium and aluminum. They used mathematical calculations and formulas because scientists are unable to study actual rocks from white dwarfs. "We can determine the geochemistry of these rocks mathematically and compare these calculations with rocks that we do have from Earth and Mars," said Doyle, whose background is in geology and mathematics. "Understanding the rocks is crucial because they reveal the geochemistry and geophysics of the planet."\n\n"If extraterrestrial rocks have a similar quantity of oxidation as the Earth has, then you can conclude the planet has similar plate tectonics and similar potential for magnetic fields as the Earth, which are widely believed to be key ingredients for life," Schlichting said. "This study is a leap forward in being able to make these inferences for bodies outside our own solar system and indicates it''s very likely there are truly Earth analogs."\n\nYoung said his department has both astrophysicists and geochemists working together.\n\n"The result," he said, "is we are doing real geochemistry on rocks from outside our solar system. Most astrophysicists wouldn''t think to do this, and most geochemists wouldn''t think to ever apply this to a white dwarf."\n\nThe research was funded by NASA.\n','\n',char(10)),'https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2019/10/191017141052.htm','27 Oct 2019','3',replace('QUESTION\n\nANSWER\n','\n',char(10)));

We’re sitting here on a bench in this café [for this part of the Interview]. Let’s assume that you understood only the most rudimentary of directions and you asked how to find the rest room. I would have to describe it to you in very specific and precise instructions. I might say, “Scoot sideways two meters off the bench. Stand erect. Lift left foot. Bend left knee until it is horizontal. Extend left foot and shift weight 300 centimeters forward…” and on and on. If you could interpret all those instructions 100 times faster than any other person in this café, you would appear to be a magician: You could run over and grab a milk shake and bring it back and set it on the table and snap your fingers, and I’d think you made the milk shake appear, because it was so fast relative to my perception. That’s exactly what a computer does. It takes these very, very simple-minded instructions—“Go fetch a number, add it to this number, put the result there, perceive if it’s greater than this other number”—but executes them at a rate of, let’s say, 1,000,000 per second.

The patient—a man in his 30s—returned from the country’s city of Wuhan (where the virus appears to have originated) to his home in Snohomish County in Washington State on January 15. He developed symptoms and sought treatment from his doctor on January 19, and a day later, a real time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) test confirmed he had the virus. The patient appears to be doing well and was being treated this week at a hospital in Everett, Wash., and placed in isolation out of an abundance of caution, said a spokesperson for the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in a news briefing on Tuesday afternoon.\n\nThe virus, called 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV), is known to have infected hundreds of people so far, and Chinese authorities have now reported at least 17 deaths. It was first identified in Wuhan late last year and is believed to have jumped from animals to humans at a local seafood market that also sold other wild animal meat. Authorities have since confirmed cases of human-to-human transmission. The pathogen is a coronavirus, a member of a family of viruses that include severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), which caused major outbreaks in 2003 and 2012, respectively.\n\nCases of 2019-nCoV have been confirmed in several other countries, including Thailand, Japan and South Korea. Three U.S. airports—in San Francisco, Los Angeles and New York City—began screening travelers from Wuhan last week. Such measures have now been expanded to two more airports—in Atlanta and Chicago—and passengers traveling to the U.S. from Wuhan will be funneled to those five locations. The risk to the U.S. public is low at this time, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. But the agency says it is working closely with other health organizations to contain the virus’s spread.\nAdvertisement\n\nNational Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases director Anthony Fauci has been been closely following developments related to the new virus. Scientific American spoke with Fauci about 2019-nCoV’s likely mode of transmission, its similarity to other coronaviruses and the question of whether a vaccine is on the horizon.\n\n[An edited transcript of the conversation follows.]\n\nDo we know how the U.S. patient contracted the virus?\n\nHe was not in any market where there may have been an animal reservoir, and he does not recall coming into contact with someone who was ill. That’s not surprising: often people contract respiratory infections without knowing the definite exposure source. But he was in Wuhan.\n\nIs the most likely source of this virus an animal market in Wuhan?\nAdvertisement\n\nIt almost certainly came from an animal—almost certainly.\n\nDo you suspect the virus is transmitted via a respiratory route?\n\nA respiratory infection is almost certainly transmitted through droplets. Respiratory spread is a very good guess. We have not definitively proved that the virus entered through the respiratory tract, but it is highly likely. When you have symptoms of fever, cough, infiltrates in the lung, and respiratory symptoms, historically, respiratory is the route.\nnewsletter promo\n\nHow similar or different is the virus from other coronaviruses such as SARS or MERS?\n\nFirst of all, it’s a coronavirus, the same family as SARS. It has some of the same molecular homology as SARS. It’s closer to SARS than it is to MERS. But it isn’t overwhelmingly close.\nAdvertisement\n\nDo we know the mortality rate of the new virus?\n\nIt’s a moving target. It’s a rough estimate. If you look at the number of cases, it’s around 300. There have been six deaths so far. [Editor’s Note: On Wednesday, several outlets reported that Chinese authorities had announced 17 deaths, and some had cited more than 540 cases.] We’re only seeing the ones who are hospitalized. If there are asymptomatic infections, the mortality rate would be much less. Among symptomatic people, the mortality rate is around 2 percent. It was 10 percent with SARS, and 30 to 35 percent with MERS. It may be less virulent than those two or it may evolve. It’s too early to know.\n\nAren’t the symptoms of this viral infection similar to many other types of respiratory infection? How can you tell them apart?\n\nIt’s a syndromic and epidemiological association. If somebody comes into an emergency room in Washington State with a respiratory illness, and they haven’t been to China, they probably have the flu or some other virus. But if they came from Wuhan, it’s likely to be the new coronavirus. The symptoms are very common to a number of viruses, though, so [the association] is based on epidemiology [and is confirmed by the rRT-PCR test].\n\nHow are the patients with this virus being treated?\n\nIt’s mostly symptomatic treatment. There are experimental antivirals that have been used in vitro and in vivo. If the patients need antibiotics for complicating bacterial infections, you give them antibiotics. If they need to be put on a respirator, they’re put on a respirator. Most patients in China are doing well. But a proportion of them are very ill and are on respirators.\n\nHow long will it be before we have a vaccine for this virus?\n\nWe’ve already started to develop a vaccine. We got the [genetic] sequence from the Chinese. We’re partnering with a company called Moderna to develop a messenger RNA–based platform for a vaccine. We will likely have a candidate in early phase I trials for safety in about three months. That doesn’t mean we will have a vaccine ready for use in three months; even in an emergency, that would take a year or more. But we’re already on it.\n\nHow common are coronaviruses, and how often do they jump from animals to humans?\n\nCoronaviruses represent 10 to 30 percent of common colds. Over the past 18 years we’ve had three coronaviruses from animal reservoirs: SARS, MERS and now this. There could be several intermediary hosts, but at least with SARS and MERS, the primary host is thought to be a bat. We don’t know what the primary host is for this virus yet.\n\n\nABOUT THE AUTHOR(S)\nTanya Lewis\n\nTanya Lewis is an associate editor at Scientific American who covers health and medicine.\n\n\n\nAll Rights Reserved.\n','\n',char(10)),'https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/infectious-disease-expert-discusses-what-we-know-about-the-new-chinese-virus/','22 Jan 2020','4',replace('QUESTION\n\nSARS is a type of coronaviruse.

Become a fan of The Energy Project on Facebook and connect with Tony at Twitter.com/TonySchwartz and Twitter.com/Energy_Project.)\n\nWhy is it that between 25% and 50% of people report feeling overwhelmed or burned out at work?\n\nIt’s not just the number of hours we’re working, but also the fact that we spend too many continuous hours juggling too many things at the same time.\n\nWhat we’ve lost, above all, are stopping points, finish lines and boundaries. Technology has blurred them beyond recognition. Wherever we go, our work follows us, on our digital devices, ever insistent and intrusive. It’s like an itch we can’t resist scratching, even though scratching invariably makes it worse.\n\nTell the truth: Do you answer email during conference calls (and sometimes even during calls with one other person)? Do you bring your laptop to meetings and then pretend you’re taking notes while you surf the net? Do you eat lunch at your desk? Do you make calls while you’re driving, and even send the occasional text, even though you know you shouldn’t?\n\nThe biggest cost — assuming you don’t crash — is to your productivity. In part, that’s a simple consequence of splitting your attention, so that you’re partially engaged in multiple activities but rarely fully engaged in any one. In part, it’s because when you switch away from a primary task to do something else, you’re increasing the time it takes to finish that task by an average of 25 per cent.\n\nBut most insidiously, it’s because if you’re always doing something, you’re relentlessly burning down your available reservoir of energy over the course of every day, so you have less available with every passing hour.\n\nI know this from my own experience. I get two to three times as much writing accomplished when I focus without interruption for a designated period of time and then take a real break, away from my desk. The best way for an organization to fuel higher productivity and more innovative thinking is to strongly encourage finite periods of absorbed focus, as well as shorter periods of real renewal.\n\nIf you’re a manager, here are three policies worth promoting:\n\n1. Maintain meeting discipline. Schedule meetings for 45 minutes, rather than an hour or longer, so participants can stay focused, take time afterward to reflect on what’s been discussed, and recover before the next obligation. Start all meetings at a precise time, end at a precise time, and insist that all digital devices be turned off throughout the meeting.\n\n2. Stop demanding or expecting instant responsiveness at every moment of the day. It forces your people into reactive mode, fractures their attention, and makes it difficult for them to sustain attention on their priorities. Let them turn off their email at certain times. If it’s urgent, you can call them — but that won’t happen very often.\n\n3. Encourage renewal. Create at least one time during the day when you encourage your people to stop working and take a break. Offer a midafternoon class in yoga, or meditation, organize a group walk or workout, or consider creating a renewal room where people can relax, or take a nap.\n\nIt’s also up to individuals to set their own boundaries. Consider these three behaviors for yourself:\n\n1. Do the most important thing first in the morning, preferably without interruption, for 60 to 90 minutes, with a clear start and stop time. If possible, work in a private space during this period, or with sound-reducing earphones. Finally, resist every impulse to distraction, knowing that you have a designated stopping point. The more absorbed you can get, the more productive you’ll be. When you’re done, take at least a few minutes to renew.\n\n2. Establish regular, scheduled times to think more long term, creatively, or strategically. If you don’t, you’ll constantly succumb to the tyranny of the urgent. Also, find a different environment in which to do this activity — preferably one that’s relaxed and conducive to open-ended thinking.\n\n3. Take real and regular vacations. Real means that when you’re off, you’re truly disconnecting from work. Regular means several times a year if possible, even if some are only two or three days added to a weekend. The research strongly suggests that you’ll be far healthier if you take all of your vacation time, and more productive overall.\n\nA single principle lies at the heart of all these suggestions. When you’re engaged at work, fully engage, for defined periods of time. When you’re renewing, truly renew. Make waves. Stop living your life in the gray zone.\n\n','\n',char(10)),'Harvard Business Review','27 Jan 2020','3',replace('QUESTION\n\nWhat is consequence of multi-tasking?\n\n\nANSWER\n\nOverwhelmed.\n','\n',char(10)));

I did not think he would accept such a humble invitation; but he did, saying, in a most friendly way, he would rather “peck” with us than by himself.

Dr. Virginia Berniger, who studies reading and writing systems and their relationship to learning processes, found that children’s writing ability was consistently better (they wrote more, faster, and more complete sentences) when they used a pen rather than a keyboard; these are, of course, subjects without a penchant for using either tool. We also previously covered the WSJ article that connected handwriting and cognitive abilities; in one of the studies cited, adults learned new symbols and graphic shapes better when they reproduced them with pen-and-paper instead of typing them.\n\nThe difference, Berniger notes, may lie in the fact that with writing, you use your hand to form the letters (and connect them), thereby more actively engaging the brain in the process. Typing, on the other hand, involves just selecting letters by pressing identical-looking keys.\n\nOf course, whether the pen or the keyboard is better for you depends on your personal experience and comfort with these tools.

Telepresence can inhibit viral transmission by reducing human-to-human contact.

In medieval Europe, for example, warring religious factions demonstrated solidarity in the face of a plague by marching together in the streets. And Native Americans expressed goodwill by gathering in the teepees of those infected with smallpox. But if we are well-prepared when an epidemic arrives, we can fluidly shift into a self-quarantined, telepresent society in which microbes fail by dint of host sparseness.\n\nWhatever the social ills of increased isolation in our computer age, they may bode worse for the microbes than for us.\n\n','\n',char(10)),'https://doi.org/10.1038/441574c','13 Jul 2020','3',replace('QUESTION\n\nWhat is the tool mentioned by the author for avoiding society collpase due to epidemic?\n\nANSWER\n\nThe Internet.\n','\n',char(10)));

However, from my experience, these lists miss the biggest\nreason — the number one reason — why projects fail: Because the\nproject manager does not manage to his or her top three priorities on\na daily basis.\n\nThis is so important that I’m going to repeat it. The number one\nreason why projects fail is that the project manager does not manage\nto his or her top three priorities on a daily basis.

For, it not being to be imagined that a child will often, if ever, dispute his father’s present command in any particular instance; and the father not interposing his absolute authority, in peremptory rules, concerning either childish or indifferent actions, wherein his son is to have his liberty; or concerning his learning or improvement, wherein there is no compulsion to be used; there remains only the prohibition of some vicious actions, wherein a child is capable of obstinacy, and consequently can deserve beating: and so there will be but very few occasions of that discipline to be used by any one, who considers well, and orders his child’s education as it should be. \n\nFor the first seven years, what vices can a child be guilty of, but lying, or some ill-natured tricks; the repeated commission whereof, after his father’s direct command against it, shall bring him into the condemnation of obstinacy, and the chastisement of the rod?

If vicious inclinations were watched from the beginning, and the first irregularities which they caused, corrected by those gentler ways, we should seldom have to do with more than one disorder at once; which would be easily set right without any stir or noise, and not require so harsh a discipline as beating.

I figured that since people ask me this so often, I had better finally write an article about it.\n\n\nUniversity\nThe most commonly-taught subject that’s related to programming in universities is called “computer science.” I say that it’s related to programming because very little of what people learn in most computer science courses will actually end up being useful in their day-to-day lives as a professional, working programmer. That’s not always true—there are some fields where computer science comes very much in handy. But in general, the field we call “software engineering” or “development” is different than what universities cover as “computer science.”\n\nUsually, the basics of computer science that universities cover are very useful. I went to university and studied computer science, and my first two years of study were very useful to me, especially the first few classes. I got a great grounding in some of the basic concepts of software development.\n\nWhat I didn’t realize at the time, though, is that computer science is only partly a study of programming. The other part is a study of algorithms. (For those who are reading this and don’t know, an algorithm is a series of steps for accomplishing some task. That’s really all it means. Even a shopping list is a sort of algorithm.) The study of algorithms usually involves learning the most efficient way to do something. That is, figuring out how to accomplish a task like sorting a list of integers using the fewest number of steps or using the least amount of memory. There are some problems that can’t be solved by computers at all unless you know the right algorithm, and once in a while you run into a problem in programming that requires this knowledge. So it does have some use. But solving these problems of algorithms is not what you will be spending most of your time doing.\n\nEven for those universities that offer courses in “software engineering,” they are rarely a full experience of what the real world will be like. The reason is that most courses only take a few months at most, and make you collaborate with only a few people at best, on a codebase of a few thousand lines of code. In the real world, you will be working with a large number of people on a codebase that will last for years that is at least tens of thousands of lines of code.

INSERT INTO article VALUES(45,replace('Meet Minimum Requirements: Anything More is Too Much\n\nSeptember 1, 1998\n\nCommit to a project plan that only includes essential function, with a “closet plan” for nonessential function.\n\nby Neal Whitten, PMP, Contributing Editor\n\nDoes this conversation between a project manager and a project outsider sound familiar? It’s a Y2K project, but it could be any project.\n\nOutsider: “Will your project complete on time?”\nPM: “We have no choice.”\nOutsider: “I didn’t ask if you had a choice. I asked will you complete on time?”\nPM: “This is an important project. There’s a lot riding on the success of this project. We must complete on time.”\n\n(Translation: “No, we won’t complete on time. Anybody with any project experience knows this.”)\n\nIs this a Y2K-unique problem? No—it’s common on most projects. The primary reason it’s so common on Y2K projects is that most of the project managers and other project leaders on these projects were trained on pre-Y2K projects. Let me explain.\n\nOne of the most common problems with projects is taking on too much work—attempting to exceed requirements rather than meet minimum requirements. This contributes to a plethora of ill effects, including late deliveries, budget overruns, low morale and poor quality. Attempting to cram the proverbial 10 pounds into a 5-pound sack is a common occurrence.\n\nOne solution is to build products that meet minimum requirements. You may be thinking that such a product would have low appeal to your client or customers, but it’s not what you think.\n\n“Meet minimum requirements” means give the client what he or she needs to be successful; but don’t provide unessential function. Additional function is what future releases and future business opportunities are all about. It is important to earn the reputation for being reliable in meeting customer commitments and then be trusted to continue to upgrade on a routine, predictable basis. This is good business.\n\nYou say you always only provide essential function? For most of us, most times, that’s not true. Have you ever faced slipped delivery dates and chosen to remove some of the function originally planned? When the project began, everyone swore that all the planned function was essential. Yet, as the project progressed—and got further behind schedule—some of that essential function no longer looked so essential.\n\nWe’ll use a Y2K project as an example, because Y2K projects are at a heightened focus these days—and, interestingly enough, the No. 2 problem with Y2K projects is that they are taking on too much work (the No. 1 problem is that too many projects are starting too late). Here’s what should occur.\nLet’s say you’ve identified 100 functions (enhancements or changes) that need to be made in your company’s programs. You know that all 100 functions are desirable, but you recognize that your limited resources won’t allow all the functions to be ready by the hoped-for date. You find that 40 functions fall within the high-priority category, 30 as medium and 30 as low. You build a project plan to implement only the 40 high priorities. Why? Because you don’t want to jeopardize the timely completion of these 40 by building a plan to include the other 60 functions—all of lesser importance and, for purposes of illustration, deemed nonessential.\n\nYou might be thinking that you should build a plan with all 100 functions and later, if (actually, when) the project gets into trouble, you can always back out of lesser-priority function. Don’t go there! This foolish plan requires spending valuable time, dollars and resources working on other-than-the-most-important functions. Moreover, when you back out, it costs again. What needs to be done is to build a plan that significantly reduces rework. This means the original plan must be only essential function.\n\nWhat about the other 60? You carefully look these over and put work-arounds in place that, although not optimal, can get you through until more substantial actions can occur.\n\nBut there is something else you do. You decide on the most important of the 60 functions—maybe it’s all of the 30 medium functions or some subset thereof—and you create multiple, independent small projects with any and all resources you can muster. I call these small projects collectively a “closet plan.” These small projects are managed with the same care and attention to quality as the primary project. If any of these small projects can complete by a predetermined date (e.g., system test) and the risk to the primary project is judged to be acceptable, then the completed small projects are merged in with the primary project. There are many advantages to this technique: from reducing risk to the primary project, to motivating the members of the small projects to complete by a predetermined date, to setting customer expectations that are most likely to be met or exceeded.\n\nMost of us have been conditioned to believe that “meets minimum requirements” is unexciting and noncompetitive. I believe it to be the opposite. Deliberately practicing meeting minimum requirements helps an organization or company to be first-to-market, earn increasing credibility from their client(s), and strongly posture their enterprise for taking on new business opportunities. Adopting the concept of meeting minimum requirements can set your organization up for exceptional performance.','\n',char(10)),'Source: https://nealwhittengroup.com/articles/meet-minimum-requirements-anything-more-is-too-much/','20 Nov 2020','4',replace('QUESTION\n\nMeeting the minimum requirements is not exciting.\nIs this statement true?\n\nANSWER\n\nFalse\n','\n',char(10)));

The simple fact is this election is far from over. Joe Biden has not been certified as the winner of any states, let alone any of the highly contested states headed for mandatory recounts, or states where our campaign has valid and legitimate legal challenges that could determine the ultimate victor. In Pennsylvania, for example, our legal observers were not permitted meaningful access to watch the counting process. Legal votes decide who is president, not the news media.\n\n“Beginning Monday, our campaign will start prosecuting our case in court to ensure election laws are fully upheld and the rightful winner is seated. The American People are entitled to an honest election: that means counting all legal ballots, and not counting any illegal ballots. This is the only way to ensure the public has full confidence in our election. It remains shocking that the Biden campaign refuses to agree with this basic principle and wants ballots counted even if they are fraudulent, manufactured, or cast by ineligible or deceased voters. Only a party engaged in wrongdoing would unlawfully keep observers out of the count room – and then fight in court to block their access.\n\n“So what is Biden hiding?
